Communication ground station -> atmega (via lora radio)

1 byte: transmitter id - 'G'
2 byte: target id - 'C'
3 byte: command:
    C = pass the rest of the packet to raspberry pi as a command (with an $C)
    L = launch immenient, switch to flight mode
    A = acknowledgement of status
    R = request for status

Communication atmega -> ground station (via lora radio)
1 byte: transmitter id - 'C'
2 byte: target id - 'G'
3 byte: command:
    S = status message, next byte is compressed status
    L = launch confirmation
    D = packet with data, followed by several bytes
    O = output from raspberry

Communication atmega -> raspberry (via serial port)
1 char: '$'
2 char:
    C = read until \n, execute as command and return the output
    F = switch to flight mode
    
    
Communication raspberry -> atmega (via serial port)
1 char: '$'
2 char:
    S = status, folowed by 3 chars, each being '0' or '1' , for each device on PI
    D = debug, send to ground station
    L = landing, switch to post flight mode
